# Wind_Speed
# This is a personal project
# I created a Command-Line Input (CLI) utility in Python to calculate the wind speed at a user-selected resolution, by using the zonal (u) and meridional (v) wind speed components provided as PNG images (compressed data). The user have the option of specifying the desired resolution in meters of degrees, and the output will be new PNG file with the wind speed calculated from the two components
# The repository contains a folder with the code, and a data sampler with 2 files of zonal and meridional wind speed components.
